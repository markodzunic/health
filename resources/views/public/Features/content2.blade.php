				<h3>Recommended Best Practice (RBP)</h3>
				<p>The RBP section sets out the best practice approach (as determined based on our knowledge, experience and ongoing sector engagement as to how a Practice should operate) with respect to various key subject areas. In choosing to use iMedical, your Practice can simply adopt and implement the policies and procedures contained within the relevant RBP section. iMedical can also be used as a focal point for staff training sessions. Best practice and consistency across your Practice is now available at your fingertips!</p>

				<h3>How our Practice differs from RBP</h3>
				<p>Each subject matter area allows for your Practice to include (in this section only) how your Practice differs from the stated RBP. For example, one Practice may choose to pay sick leave whilst another Practice will not pay sick leave or one Practice may have a different approach to management of results to that of another Practice. It is important, therefore, for each Practice to be able to specify how they differ from RBP so that all staff are aware of the policy in question. In any event, your Practice will have the benefit of having RBP available as a default starting point. </p>
