				<p>Once your Practice is registered to use iMedical, then each permitted staff member will have access to the GP Knowledge Box via the iMedical Dashboard.</p>

				<p>iMedical comprises user-based access which means that the content is tailored to the specific role of the user i.e. a Practice Manager will have access to certain information that a Practice Nurse or Doctor does not need to see or access for the purposes of carrying out their own role and vice versa. This allows for simple navigation and use. </p>

				<p>The GP Knowledge Box comprises 9 individual subject areas from Clinical Management to Infection Control. Each subject area, in turn, is made up of the following elements:</p>

						<strong>Recommended Best Practice (RBP)</strong>
						<br>
						<p>The RBP section sets out the best practice approach (as determined by us based on our experience, research and strongly considered views on how a Practice should operate) with respect to various key subject areas. In the case of Human Resources for example, the RBK will effectively constitute the Staff Handbook for the practice by setting out the policy of the Practice regarding annual leave, grievances, disciplinary matters and staff development etc. This satisfies the good-practice requirement for a Staff Handbook and demonstrating how it is actually disseminated to staff. Furthermore, RBK can be used as a focal point for staff training sessions. Consistency across your Practice is now available at your fingertips!</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>How our Practice differs from RBP</strong>
						<br>
						<p>Each subject matter area allows for your Practice to include (in this section only) how your Practice differs from the stated RBK in the section above. For example, one Practice may choose to pay sick leave whilst another Practice will not pay sick leave. It is important, therefore, for each Practice to be able to specify how they differ from RBK so that all staff are aware of the policy in question. In any event, your Practice will have the benefit of having RBP available as a default starting point. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Checklists</strong>
						<br>
						<p>Checklists are a simple and important tool for ensuring that recurring tasks are completed fully and timely. We have included several checklists under each subject matter area that will make daily, weekly, monthly and annual tasks easy to manage and ensure that there are no dropped balls. Life just got a whole lot easier!</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Template Documents</strong>
						<br>
						<p>Our bank of template documents have been prepared with great care and attention to detail. These documents are easy to access and use. Our template bank will be padded further with even more fantastic and helpful documents. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>FAQs â€“ Topic Specific</strong>
						<br>
						<p>Our FAQs are a simple way for us to provide answers to recurring queries or problems in a way that is easy to digest. </p>
