							<h3>Data Protection</h3>
							<p>A balance must be struck between the use of personal information against the protection of individual privacy. Confidentiality is an essential part of the relationship between a healthcare provider and their patients.</p>

							<p>If patients are concerned that they cannot speak freely to a healthcare provider or that their personal details will not be respected and protected, then a patient may well not disclose important facts. However, without such information, it can be difficult (if not impossible) to obtain a full and accurate understanding of the patient’s symptoms or their reasons for seeking help. Information sharing is, therefore, at the heart of providing the patient with appropriate advice and treatment.</p>

							<p>Data protection legislation aims to safeguard personal data by protecting an individual’s right to privacy while, at the same time, allowing a Practice to use personal information legitimately. </p>

							<p>Healthcare providers have a duty to their patients to protect personal data. This duty is further enhanced by the new General Data Protection Regulation (<strong>GDPR</strong>) which comes into effect in May 2018. </p>

							<p>It is important to try and avoid any inadvertent breach of Data Protection legislation to prevent any unnecessary harm or distress to patients, and to avoid liability, embarrassment and reputational damage to the Practice. It is, therefore, very important to develop a culture of awareness and accountability among Practice staff when it comes to Data Protection, Privacy and security issues.</p>

							<p><strong>Don’t worry, iMedical is GDPR ready!!</strong></p>
