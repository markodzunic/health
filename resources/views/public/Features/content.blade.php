						<div class="im-accordion">
							<h3>Data Protection</h3>
							<p>A balance must be struck between the use of personal information against the protection of individual privacy. Confidentiality is an essential part of the relationship between a healthcare provider and their patients. </p> 

							<p>If patients are concerned that they cannot speak freely to a healthcare provider or that their personal details will not be respected and protected, then a patient may well not disclose important facts. However, without such information, it can be difficult (if not impossible) to obtain a full and accurate understanding of the patient’s symptoms or their reasons for seeking help. Information sharing is, therefore, at the heart of providing the patient with appropriate advice and treatment.</p>

							<p>Data protection legislation aims to safeguard personal data by protecting an individual’s right to privacy while, at the same time, allowing a Practice to use personal information legitimately. </p>

							<p>Healthcare providers have a duty to their patients to protect personal data. This duty is further enhanced by the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which comes into effect in May 2018. </p>

							<p>It is important to try and avoid any inadvertent breach of Data Protection legislation to prevent any unnecessary harm or distress to patients, and to avoid liability (including under the GDPR), embarrassment and reputational damage to the Practice. It is, therefore, very important to develop a culture of awareness and accountability among Practice staff when it comes to Data Protection, Privacy and security issues.</p>

							<p>iMedical sets out information on the general principles of data protection and the GDPR, including standard data protection practice, the requirements for Privacy Impact Assessments, and what to do in the event of a data breach. iMedical is an excellent tool for creating awareness among and training staff in Data Protection best practice.</p>

							<p>iMedical also includes significant information around Information Security and outlines what you need to do ensure that all information controlled and processed by your Practice is secure and managed correctly. </p>

					{{-- Finances --}}
						<div class="im-accordion">
							<h3>Finances</h3>
							<p>A General Practice needs to be run with top class patient care as the primary objective. In order to safeguard the ability of the Practice to do so, it needs to be run as a successful business so that it can continue to invest in the best equipment and resources. Proper financial management is, therefore, essential.</p>
							<p>iMedical outlines how your Practice should approach charging for its services (Private, Corporate and State Contracts) and provides an easy-access overview of the GMS claim structure and process, including details of the Under 6s and also Special Services. Relevant checklists make tasks easy to complete and bring consistency to financial management.</p>

					{{-- Health & Safety --}}
						<div class="im-accordion">
							<h3>Health & Safety</h3>
							<p>Medical practices and clinics are inherently risky workplaces. Risks can include communicable diseases, exposure to hazardous materials, needle stick and sharps injuries, violence and verbal aggression from patients and co-workers, to name just a few. Injuries can be physical or psychological.</p>
							<p>Medical workplaces need to develop a culture of best practice when it comes to safety. This requires constant vigilance and improvement wherever possible. </p>
							<p>Safe practice involves taking a proactive approach toward the safety of Practice staff and patients. In a fast-paced medical workplace this must involve appropriate supervision of less experienced staff. It also requires easily accessible, practical policies and procedures to be in place. A systematic approach will give better outcomes - this is the responsibility of employers, supported by all in the workplace. </p>
							<p>iMedical includes information on the general principles of Health & Safety pursuant to Irish legislation and also the recommendations of the Health and Safety Authority in Ireland. Our Health & Safety RBP comprises a detailed Practice Safety Statement which each Practice is required to have under law. Employer and employee duties care clearly set out as is the requirement for and functions of a Practice Safety Officer, including Accident Reporting. iMedical also sets out how to complete a Practice Health and Safety Risk Assessment, apply relevant controls and audit ongoing compliance. </p>

					{{-- Emergency Planning --}}
						<div class="im-accordion">
							<h3>Emergency Planning</h3>
							<p>Disasters and emergencies are unpredictable and destructive. They can cause significant damage, injury, illness, loss, trauma and grief. In an emergency, it is generally expected that the demand for healthcare services will rise, especially in the event of a pandemic. </p>
							<p>Comprehensive planning can assist in reducing the overall impact of an emergency and reduce liability and financial loss due to damages sustained during an event. Having an emergency response plan will increase the Practice capacity to continue to provide essential services to patients during an emergency. The plan will identify contingency measures that can be implemented to reduce the impact of an emergency and outline appropriate actions to ensure that the Practice can keep running (even if only in a limited capacity) until the Practice fully recovers and can return to normal operations.</p>
							<p>iMedical outlines how a Practice should approach Emergency Planning and the preparation and implementation of an Emergency Action Plan including staff training, use of Action Cards and a Practice Battlebox.</p>
						</div>
					{{-- Patient Management --}}
						<div class="im-accordion">
							<h3>Patient Management</h3>
							<p>Responding promptly and positively to patient expectations is an essential part of providing quality General Practice services. It is essential for a Practice to engage with its patients and continue to build relationships and trust with them. As patients are becoming more responsible for the cost of their care, providing a high-quality patient experience is more important than ever. To assist your Practice in developing and maintaining patient relationships and trust and providing the best service possible, iMedical sets out guidelines and policies for staff to follow and implement in relation to staff conduct, new patients, patients in distress, non-English speaking patients, handling difficult patients and managing patient complaints and grievances. </p>
						</div>
					{{-- Practice Operations --}}
						<div class="im-accordion">
							<h3>Practice Operations</h3>
							<p>Medical Practices are getting busier whilst the resources available to help with increased demand have reduced. The only option for Practice owners, operators and staff is to increase and preserve efficiency daily to create and operate an efficient and organised Practice. The importance of all staff understanding and implementing the same approach to processes and completion of tasks is critical to ensuring consistency, productivity and best practice. </p>
							<p>iMedical outlines best practice relating to appointment management, telephone administration, post / mail, email & fax communications, Practice visitors and internal communication.</p>
						</div>
					{{-- Clinical Management --}}
						<div class="im-accordion">
							<h3>Clinical Management</h3>
							<p>Every Practice must have a clinical risk management system in place to enhance the quality and safety of its patient care. Minimising the level of risk to patient safety and care means that your Practice needs to have documented systems in place to help identify, monitor and change practices that cause mistakes and near misses. Risk management is also about planning for contingencies such as natural disasters, pandemic diseases or sudden, unexpected absence of clinical team members.</p>
							<p>iMedical outlines useful guidance to assist your Practice in developing, implementing and monitoring a robust system of clinical governance, education and training in relation to consent to medical treatment, continuity of care, Doctor autonomy, clinical audit, repeat prescribing, clinical incident reporting, open disclosure, referrals, results management, vaccinations and cold chain management. </p>
