					<a href="#" class="h5 im-toggle-menu-item">Why is there an Annual Subscription Fee? </a>

					<div class="im-toggle-content">
					<p>We decided that the best way to make iMedical available was on an annual subscription basis. This means no prohibitive upfront costs. You can decide on an annual basis whether you wish to continue using iMedical for the subsequent year. We fully expect that you will given its affordability, regular updates (meaning you don't have to worry about using outdated information) and the essential feature of Practice staff being able to access relevant information in an easy and efficient way whilst in clinic or otherwise under time pressure. </p>

					<p>We are confident that the annual subscription fee for access to and use of iMedical will be the best money your Practice will spend year on year. Happily too, it is tax deductible as a business expense! The annual fee is fully payable in advance and is non-refundable. </p>
