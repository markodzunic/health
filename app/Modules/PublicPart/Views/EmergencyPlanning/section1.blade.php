				<p>Disasters and emergencies are unpredictable and destructive. They can cause significant damage, injury, illness, loss, trauma and grief.</p>
				<p>In an emergency, it is generally expected that the demand for healthcare services will rise, especially in the event of a pandemic. In an emergency, our Practice may experience:</p>

				<ul class="im-list im-list-pink">
					<li>minor or significant damage to the Practice infrastructure</li>
					<li>increased demand for services</li>
					<li>increased presentation of patients with injuries or highly infectious symptoms</li>
					<li>loss of critical equipment and supplies</li>
					<li>loss of access to key information</li>
					<li>loss of access to essential systems, networks and communication</li>
					<li>reduction in capacity and the loss of key staff</li>
					<li>Practice closure</li>
					<li>loss of/disruption to power supply</li>
					<li>loss of/contamination of water supply.</li>

				<p>Comprehensive planning can assist in reducing the overall impact of an emergency and reduce liability and financial loss due to damages sustained during an event. Having an emergency response plan will increase a practiceâ€™s capacity to continue to provide essential services to patients during an emergency. The plan will identify contingency measures that can be implemented to reduce the impact of an emergency and outline appropriate actions to ensure that the Practice can keep running (even if only in a limited capacity) until the Practice fully recovers and can return to normal operations.</p>
				<p>Being prepared for an emergency means that we are more likely to have effective continuity of care arrangements for our patients while ensuring that business operations continue to run as smoothly as possible. Furthermore, this will allow our Practice to help in responding to the health needs of our wider community in the event of a disaster.</p>
